|algorithm
|Strings
|The routing algorithm to be used. Valid values: +
'DIJKSTRA': Routes are computed using Dijkstra's algorithm. +
'FLOYD_WARSHALL': Routes are computed using Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

|edgeEvaluators
|List of strings
|The types of route evaluators/cost factors to be used. +
Results of multiple evaluators are added up. Valid values: +
'DISTANCE': A route's cost is the sum of the lengths of its paths. +
'TRAVELTIME': A route's cost is the vehicle's expected driving time to the destination. +
'TURNS': A route's cost is the number of turns/direction changes on it. +
'EXPLICIT': A route's cost is the sum of the explicitly given costs of its paths.
